# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project focuses on clustering customers into different segments using unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as KMeans and DBSCAN.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains demographic and behavioral data about customers.

**Main features include:**
- Gender, Age, Marital Status
- Education level
- Profession, Work Experience
- Spending Score
- Family Size

## 🧪 Project Steps
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Feature Encoding & Scaling**
4. **Clustering using KMeans & DBSCAN**
5. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**
6. **Evaluation using Silhouette Score**

## 🖼️ Visualizations
Several plots are used to understand customer segments, feature distributions, and cluster behavior.

## 📦 Requirements
Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run
